You are working in the CaseCurrent codebase.

Goal: Improve the marketing homepage conversion by replacing the homepage copy with a tighter, sales-focused version (PI + Family, governance + predictability positioning). Keep the existing visual design and layout as much as possible—change TEXT, headings, bullets, and CTA labels/links.

Steps:
1) Locate the marketing homepage file. Common locations:
   - app/page.tsx
   - app/(marketing)/page.tsx
   - pages/index.tsx
   - src/app/page.tsx
   - src/pages/index.tsx
2) Replace the existing hero headline/subheadline, section headings, paragraphs, and bullet lists with the copy in the “DROP-IN HOMEPAGE COPY” below.
3) Ensure there are two CTAs in the hero and final section:
   - Primary CTA button text: "Book a demo" linking to /demo
   - Secondary CTA button text: "See how intake works" linking to /how-it-works
   If these routes don’t exist, create simple pages with placeholder content (H1 + 2 short paragraphs) so links don’t 404.
4) Add/verify SEO metadata (title + description) for the homepage:
   - Title: "CaseCurrent — AI Voice Intake for Personal Injury & Family Law"
   - Description: "Capture every lead with rules-first AI intake: 24/7 voice answering, structured summaries, follow-ups, and predictable handoffs for PI and family firms."
5) Do NOT add new dependencies. Do NOT redesign styling. Only adjust content and ensure links work.
6) After changes, output:
   - The files changed
   - The exact diffs
   - A short checklist of what to click to verify in the browser

DROP-IN HOMEPAGE COPY (use these exact words):

HERO
Headline: "Never miss a case-worthy call again."
Subheadline: "CaseCurrent is an AI voice intake system built for personal injury and family law. It answers 24/7, captures the right details, sends clean follow-ups, and hands your team a structured lead—without sounding like a robot."
Primary CTA: "Book a demo"
Secondary CTA: "See how intake works"
Micro-proof: "Built for firms that want more signed cases, fewer dropped leads, and zero chaos."

SECTION: PROBLEM
Heading: "Most firms don’t lose leads—they lose momentum."
Bullets:
- "Missed calls after hours (and during peak hours) become “I called someone else.”"
- "Intake is inconsistent: great one day, messy the next."

Closer: "CaseCurrent turns every inbound call into a controlled, trackable intake flow."
