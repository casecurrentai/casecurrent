REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — Apply new logo pack + update brand blue + improve MOBILE marketing site (wireframes + guilloche)

Inputs (already uploaded)
- casecurrent_logo_pack.zip (in the repo root or project files)

Brand colors (exact)
- Primary Blue: #1764FE
- Gradient helper: #1764FE → #D3E1FE

Scope (do all)
1) Use the ZIP to replace the CaseCurrent logo mark + wordmark everywhere:
   - Marketing site (responsive web, including mobile layout)
   - Mobile app (Expo app)
2) Update the app/site “primary blue” to #1764FE (remove old primary like #57A6D5).
3) Mobile marketing site improvements:
   A) Add more “wireframe” elements to sections BELOW the header on ALL marketing pages (mobile view).
      - Currently too generic; it should look like a real product wireframe: cards, list rows, timeline, mini charts placeholders, badges, icons, etc.
   B) Fix guilloche: every marketing page EXCEPT the primary Home landing page is missing the signature guilloche.
      - Add guilloche behind the header text/elements on each page.
      - Add guilloche in at least ONE additional section below the header on each page.
   C) Ensure the new logo appears on the mobile marketing site header/nav and on the mobile app header/login.

Non-negotiables
- Do NOT rename internal identifiers (CounselTech internals can stay). Branding changes are public-facing only.
- Do NOT do a full redesign. Improve the mobile marketing pages by adding structure and tasteful wireframe visuals; keep existing typography/layout philosophy.
- Provide proof: file list + grep evidence + describe what changed per page.

============================================================
PART 1 — Unzip and install logo assets
1) Find + unzip:
   find . -maxdepth 4 -name "casecurrent_logo_pack.zip"
   unzip -l casecurrent_logo_pack.zip
   unzip -o casecurrent_logo_pack.zip -d /tmp/casecurrent_logo_pack

2) Copy the four variants into:
   - apps/web/public/brand/
   - apps/mobile/assets/brand/   (if mobile uses assets; if not, place where current app expects images)

3) Wire usage:
   - Web marketing site: swap to /brand/<new-file> references.
   - Mobile app: update imports/usages in Login, Header, Settings/About, etc.

============================================================
PART 2 — Update primary brand blue everywhere
Targets:
- Replace #57A6D5 (known old) with #1764FE
- Update theme tokens (preferred) rather than scattered hexes
Commands:
  grep -RIn "#57A6D5" . || true
  grep -RIn "#1764FE" . || true

Mobile specifically:
- apps/mobile/App.tsx tabBarActiveTintColor -> #1764FE
- apps/mobile/src/theme/colors.ts (or equivalent) primary -> #1764FE

Web specifically:
- CSS vars / tailwind theme / shadcn theme tokens primary -> #1764FE

============================================================
PART 3 — MOBILE marketing site: add wireframe elements + guilloche per page
IMPORTANT: This is specifically about MOBILE view of the marketing site (responsive). Desktop can remain largely unchanged.

Step A — Identify marketing pages/routes
- Find marketing site routes/pages in apps/web (or wherever):
  - likely: apps/web/src/pages, apps/web/src/routes, apps/web/src/app, or similar
- List the page components found (Home + other pages).

Step B — Create reusable Guilloche background component
Create ONE reusable component and use it everywhere to avoid duplicated SVG/CSS.

Example approach (pick the best fit for repo):
1) Add an SVG guilloche asset:
   apps/web/public/patterns/guilloche.svg
   OR inline SVG in a component if preferred.

2) Create a component:
   apps/web/src/components/GuillocheBackdrop.tsx
   - Props: intensity (opacity), scale, position, rotate, mask/clip option
   - Implementation: absolutely positioned background layer with:
     - low opacity
     - slight blur optional
     - masked gradient so text remains readable

3) Apply it:
   - On EVERY marketing page (EXCEPT Home): header area must have guilloche behind title/subtitle/CTA.
   - Also on EACH page: at least one section below header has guilloche in the background.

Acceptance rule:
- You should be able to grep for GuillocheBackdrop usage and see it in every non-Home page component at least twice:
  1) header
  2) at least one below-header section

Step C — Add wireframe elements below header on ALL marketing pages (mobile view)
The current mobile sections are too generic. Improve by adding wireframe “product UI” blocks (lightweight, not real screenshots):
- Examples of acceptable wireframe blocks (use 2–4 per page, below header):
  - “Lead Inbox” card list (3–5 rows with avatar circles + lines)
  - “Call summary” card with waveform placeholder
  - “Intake timeline” vertical steps with icons and timestamps
  - “Conversion dashboard” mini chart placeholder (simple bars/lines)
  - “Automation rules” list with toggles
  - “Secure upload” card with drag/drop placeholder
  - “AI suggestions” callout with bullet chips

Implementation guidance:
- Create reusable components:
  - WireframeCard
  - WireframeList
  - WireframeTimeline
  - WireframeChartMini
- Only show these in mobile layout (or make them responsive):
  - Use existing breakpoints/tailwind/responsive utilities.
- Keep the visuals subtle and on-brand:
  - Borders/lines using neutral grays
  - Accent highlights using #1764FE
  - Avoid heavy gradients except the brand gradient used for emphasis.

Step D — Ensure logo swap in marketing site header/nav (mobile)
- Update header/nav component used across marketing pages:
  - Replace old logo with new lockup or mark based on available space:
    - Mobile: mark-only (left) + text if it fits
    - Desktop: full lockup
- Ensure correct contrast:
  - On blue header backgrounds, use the “onblue” version from the pack.

============================================================
PART 4 — Proof + verification (mandatory)
Return:
1) “Files changed” list (concise).
2) Proof commands output:
   - grep -RIn "#57A6D5" .   (should be zero)
   - grep -RIn "#1764FE" .   (should show theme tokens + usage)
   - grep -RIn "GuillocheBackdrop" apps/web/src
   - grep -RIn "/brand/" apps/web/src apps/web/public (logo references)
3) For each marketing page, describe:
   - Where guilloche was added (header + which section below)
   - What wireframe components were added below header
4) Run the simplest build check available in repo and report pass/fail.

Execution order (do not skip)
1) Unzip + place logos
2) Wire logos web + mobile
3) Update blue tokens
4) Add GuillocheBackdrop + wireframe components
5) Apply per page
6) Proof + build check

Start with Step A only:
- Identify marketing pages/routes and the shared header component file path(s).
- Report what you found, then proceed.
