Task: Fix EAS Build validation error and make GitHub “Build from GitHub” work.

Context:
Expo is rejecting our eas.json with: `eas.json is not valid - "build.production.nodeEnv" is not allowed`.
We are building from GitHub with Base directory = `apps/mobile`.

Goals:
1) Remove the invalid `nodeEnv` field from `build.production`.
2) Use Expo-supported configuration for environments.
3) Ensure the file is valid JSON and is located where Expo expects it for a monorepo (`apps/mobile/eas.json`).
4) Commit + push to `main` so Expo “Build from GitHub” stops erroring.

Instructions:
A) Open `apps/mobile/eas.json` and remove:
   `"nodeEnv": "production"` from `build.production`.

B) Add `environment` to each profile to align with EAS Environment Variables selection:
   - development -> "development"
   - preview     -> "preview"
   - production  -> "production"

C) If we still need NODE_ENV behavior at runtime, set it using `env` (allowed) instead of nodeEnv:
   In `production`, add:
   "env": { "NODE_ENV": "production" }

D) The resulting build section should look like this (keep other existing keys unless they conflict):

{
  "cli": { "version": ">= 5.0.0" },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "environment": "development",
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal",
      "ios": { "resourceClass": "medium" }
    },
    "preview": {
      "environment": "preview",
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": { "buildType": "apk" },
      "ios": { "simulator": true }
    },
    "production": {
      "environment": "production",
      "env": { "NODE_ENV": "production" },
      "ios": { "resourceClass": "medium" }
    }
  },
  "submit": { "production": {} }
}

E) Validate:
- Run a JSON lint check (or equivalent) to confirm valid JSON.
- Ensure Expo will read this file from `apps/mobile` (since GitHub build Base directory is `apps/mobile`).

F) Commit and push:
- Commit message: `Fix eas.json env config (remove nodeEnv)`
- Push to `main`.

Deliverable:
- Confirm the exact diff made.
- Confirm commit hash on `main`.
- Confirm Expo “Build from GitHub” no longer errors on eas.json validation.
