We are still hearing “This number is not currently configured” when calling +18443214257. That response only happens when our /v1/telephony/twilio/voice handler fails to find a phone_numbers row for the inbound To value.

I want definitive proof from the LIVE request path.

TASK A — Add diagnostic logging (do NOT leak secrets)
In server/routes.ts inside POST /v1/telephony/twilio/voice, right before the “not configured” TwiML is returned, log these fields (masked):
- req.headers["host"]
- req.originalUrl
- content-type
- req.body.To (raw)
- req.body.To trimmed
- normalized versions:
  1) raw
  2) trimmed
  3) ensurePlus = startsWith("+") ? value : "+" + digits
  4) digitsOnly (strip non-digits)
  5) e164Guess = "+1" + digitsOnly if 10 digits else "+" + digitsOnly

Then run the lookup using ALL candidates:
WHERE e164 IN [raw, trimmed, ensurePlus, e164Guess]
Also try digits-based fallback:
WHERE REPLACE(e164,'+','') = digitsOnly OR REPLACE(REPLACE(e164,'+',''),'-','') = digitsOnly (or equivalent in Prisma: fetch candidates and compare in JS)

Log whether any match was found and which e164 matched.

TASK B — Prove which database the deployed server is connected to
Add a single log line (masked) that prints a stable fingerprint of DATABASE_URL (NOT the full value).
Example:
- parse DATABASE_URL host + db name (or the last 6 chars of the db name), and log: “[DB] host=<host> db=<db>”
Do not print username/password.

TASK C — Prove the row exists in THAT database
On server startup (or via a one-off script run in the same environment as the published server), query:
SELECT e164, org_id, inbound_enabled FROM phone_numbers WHERE e164 = '+18443214257';
(or Prisma equivalent)
and log the result.

TASK D — Re-test with a real call
After deploying changes, call +18443214257 again and paste the production logs from the Twilio request showing:
- The exact To value received
- The DB fingerprint
- Whether the phone number row exists / matched
- Which match path succeeded/failed

Do NOT claim success without the logs.
