We are live-testing Twilio → SIP → OpenAI Realtime and calls ring once then end. Twilio is dialing SIP successfully (it says “Connecting…”), but the SIP leg is being declined quickly.

GOAL: Fix OpenAI inbound webhook handling so calls are accepted instead of rejected due to org lookup failure.

WHAT TO DO (DO NOT HAND-WAVE):
1) Add structured diagnostic logging in handleIncomingCall:
   - log event.type, call_id
   - log all sip_headers names received (mask values)
   - explicitly log:
     - extracted twilioCallSid (from X-Twilio-CallSid and/or P-Asserted-Identity)
     - extracted toNumber/fromNumber
     - whether a Call record was found by twilioCallSid
     - final orgId used (or “NOT FOUND”)
   Keep masking on.

2) Change org resolution priority:
   - FIRST: if twilioCallSid exists, find Call by twilioCallSid.
       - If found, use call.orgId (do NOT try findOrgByPhoneNumber).
       - Update providerCallId with OpenAI call_id if missing.
       - Proceed to acceptCall(call_id) and startRealtimeSession(call_id, call.orgId).
   - ONLY IF NO twilioCallSid match: then try findOrgByPhoneNumber(toNumber) as a fallback.

3) Remove/avoid rejecting calls with 603 just because toNumber-based org lookup fails when we DO have twilioCallSid.
   - Reject only if neither twilioCallSid match nor toNumber match yields an org.

4) Verify Twilio voice handler is creating the Call record BEFORE bridging to SIP:
   - Must persist twilioCallSid, orgId, toE164, fromE164.
   - Ensure it is idempotent (upsert or findUnique by twilioCallSid).

5) Improve SIP URI compatibility:
   - Add secure media parameter in the SIP URI: ;secure=true (keep ;transport=tls).
   - Log the final SIP URI (masked) that Twilio is dialing.

6) After deploying, I will place a real call. I need logs showing:
   - Twilio webhook hit and TwiML returned
   - OpenAI realtime.call.incoming webhook hit
   - acceptCall succeeded (not 404)
   - if acceptCall fails, log response status + body

Deliverable: commit changes + tell me exactly which log lines to look for (prefix them consistently like [OpenAI Webhook DIAG]).
