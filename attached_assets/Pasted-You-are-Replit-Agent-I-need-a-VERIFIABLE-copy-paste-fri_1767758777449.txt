You are Replit Agent. I need a VERIFIABLE, copy/paste-friendly technical audit of the CounselTech repo as it exists RIGHT NOW. Output ONE SINGLE CONTIGUOUS BLOCK of plain text that I can copy from mobile.

NON-NEGOTIABLE ACCURACY RULES
- NO guessing. If you cannot prove a claim with a file path or command output, write: NOT IMPLEMENTED.
- Every feature claim must include: (a) file path(s), (b) function/handler name(s) when applicable, and (c) what it does.
- Do NOT propose improvements until AFTER the audit is complete.

FIRST: RUN AND INCLUDE THESE PROOF COMMANDS (paste the output inline)
1) Repo inventory:
   - `ls -la`
   - `find . -maxdepth 4 -print`
   - If git exists: `git rev-parse HEAD` (if not, say “NO GIT”)

2) Runtime / build proof:
   - Show root `package.json` scripts (paste the scripts section)
   - Show any other `package.json` scripts used by apps (api/web/client/etc.)
   - Show Replit config files if present: `.replit`, `replit.nix`, `replit.yaml` (paste relevant parts)
   - State the exact command Replit runs in dev and in prod, and the true runtime entrypoint file(s) with paths.

3) Full backend route inventory (PROVE IT)
   - Provide a programmatic dump of all Express routes at runtime (METHOD + PATH), and paste the output.
   - Provide grep inventory results:
     - `rg "app\.(get|post|put|patch|delete)\(" -n server`
     - `rg "router\.(get|post|put|patch|delete)\(" -n server`
   - Then present a consolidated table: METHOD | PATH | AUTH REQUIRED | HANDLER FILE:LINE | DESCRIPTION

4) Integration existence proof (grep results)
   - OpenAI / Realtime / WebRTC / SIP:
     - `rg "(openai|realtime|wss://api.openai.com|responses\.create|client_secrets|WebRTC|sip\.api\.openai\.com)" -n .`
   - Twilio:
     - `rg "(twilio|TwiML|<Response>|/v1/telephony/twilio)" -n server`
   - WebSockets:
     - `rg "(ws|WebSocket|socket\.io)" -n .`

5) Database layer proof
   - `rg "(PrismaClient|@prisma/client|prisma\.)" -n .`
   - `rg "(drizzle|drizzle-kit)" -n .`
   - State clearly which layer the runtime server actually uses (Prisma/Drizzle/Both/Neither) with file evidence.

NOW: WRITE THE TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE REPORT (single block) USING THESE EXACT SECTIONS

0) Executive Snapshot (technical)
- What this system currently is (monolith/services), runtime, languages, frameworks
- What works end-to-end today (only what you can prove)

1) Full Repository Map
- Provide the file tree (top to bottom) derived from the `find` output, plus identify runtime entrypoints.

2) Runtime + Build Configuration
- Dependencies, scripts, TypeScript/build tooling, Replit deployment mode, port usage.

3) Environment Variables + Secrets
- Every env var referenced, REQUIRED vs OPTIONAL, with file:line references.

4) API Surface Area (Backend)
- The consolidated route table (METHOD | PATH | AUTH | HANDLER | DESCRIPTION)
- Call out webhook endpoints separately.

5) AuthN/AuthZ
- JWT/session details, token payload shape, roles, middleware chain, impersonation.

6) Data Layer
- DB type, connection method, ORM usage, model/tables list (name + purpose), migrations, seed scripts.

7) Telephony + Voice (CRITICAL)
- Twilio: inbound voice, status, recording, SMS — exact behaviors + TwiML returned (paste full TwiML)
- SIP trunking: implemented or NOT IMPLEMENTED (prove)
- OpenAI Realtime voice: implemented or NOT IMPLEMENTED (prove)
- Transcription/TTS pipeline: implemented or NOT IMPLEMENTED (prove)
- Call transfer/routing: implemented or NOT IMPLEMENTED (prove)

8) Messaging (SMS/MMS/Email/Web Chat)
- Inbound/outbound status for each channel with code references.

9) “Agentic” Intelligence Layer
- Prompt storage/versioning, tools/function calling, RAG/KB, guardrails/disclaimers enforcement (prove or NOT IMPLEMENTED).

10) Frontend / Dashboard / Mobile
- Which frontend(s) are actually used, routes/pages, auth integration, mobile responsiveness approach.

11) Observability + Ops
- Logging, error handling, rate limiting, CORS, security headers, CSRF, background jobs/cron, retries.

12) Tests
- Test frameworks, what exists, how to run, what coverage is real.

13) Gaps / NOT IMPLEMENTED (hard truth)
- A bullet list of missing capabilities required for a sellable CounselTech real-time voice intake agent.
- For each gap: the closest related code area or “no related code exists.”

END WITH:
- Maturity score (0–10) for: Telephony, Realtime Voice, Agentic Tools, Dashboard, Security.
- A short “What is truly production-ready today vs what is prototype/stub.”
