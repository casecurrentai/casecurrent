TASK: INSERT “AVERY MASTER PROMPT” INTO session.update INSTRUCTIONS SAFELY + VERIFY IT’S ACTIVE

Goal
Replace the existing `session.update.session.instructions` with the Avery Master Prompt we will provide, using correct JS/TS string syntax (no broken backticks, no stray quotes, and NO markdown code fences inside the instructions). Then double-check that production call flow is using this updated prompt.

Non-negotiable requirements
1) DO NOT include any markdown fences (no ```text, no ````text, etc.) inside the `instructions` string.
2) `instructions` MUST be a single valid template literal using backticks:
   instructions: `...`
3) `${generateVoicePromptInstructions()}` MUST be inside the same template literal at the end.
4) Replace smart quotes with straight quotes inside the prompt (recommended for voice stability).
5) Add a small server-side log line (not spoken) confirming the prompt is being injected.

Exact implementation steps
A) Find the real session.update location
- Search repo for: `type: 'session.update'` and/or `type: "session.update"`
- Identify the PRIMARY call path used for live inbound calls (Twilio realtime / websocket / agent session creation).
- Report the file path and function name.

B) Replace the `instructions` value correctly
- In that `session.update` payload, replace ONLY the `instructions:` field with this exact structure:

instructions: `<<PASTE AVERY MASTER PROMPT HERE (NO BACKTICKS, NO ``` FENCES)>>
${generateVoicePromptInstructions()}
`,

IMPORTANT:
- Paste the prompt content directly after the first backtick.
- Do not include ANY backticks inside the prompt content you paste.
- Do not include ANY ```text fences inside the prompt content you paste.
- The closing backtick must be on its own line after `${generateVoicePromptInstructions()}`.
- Do not add extra quotes like '' or "" after the closing backtick.
- Ensure there are no mismatched delimiters and the file still compiles.

C) Add verification logging (server-side only)
Right before sending the session.update payload (or immediately after constructing it), add:
console.log("[PROMPT_ACTIVE] AVERY_MASTER_PROMPT injected into session.update");

If the code builds instructions in a variable, also log:
console.log("[PROMPT_LEN]", instructions.length);

D) Double-check prompt is truly used at runtime
- Confirm that the code path you edited is executed during a real inbound call.
- If there are multiple session.update blocks (dev/test/prod), ensure the production one is updated.
- If prompt can come from DB/env/other module, confirm your change overrides it.

E) Output a proof report
Return:
1) The exact file path and code excerpt showing the corrected `instructions: \`...\`` block (15–30 lines).
2) Where the log line was added.
3) A one-step verification checklist for Mike:
   - Make a test call
   - Watch logs
   - Confirm seeing: “[PROMPT_ACTIVE] AVERY_MASTER_PROMPT injected into session.update”
   - Confirm “[PROMPT_LEN] <number>” is non-zero and stable

Constraints
- Do not refactor names across the codebase.
- Do not change Twilio wiring, endpoints, or tool schemas.
- Only touch what’s required to safely insert the prompt and verify it’s active.

After you confirm the correct file/location, I (Mike) will paste the full “AVERY MASTER PROMPT” text for you to insert exactly where instructed.
