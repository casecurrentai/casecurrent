You said: “I’ve updated the seed endpoint… Please click Publish… Then I’ll call seed… verify diag… test Twilio webhook… add diagnostic endpoint… Republish this App.”

DO THIS NOW, END-TO-END, AND PROVIDE PROOF AT EACH STEP.

GOAL
Republish the app so production has the new seed behavior (auto-create org if missing, then create phone number), then verify production is correctly configured and Twilio no longer returns “not configured”.

STEPS

1) Publish / Republish
- Click “Publish” (or “Republish”) in Replit to deploy the latest code.
PROOF:
- Provide the deployed URL/host and a screenshot or the deployment log line(s) showing the new deployment completed successfully.

2) Call production seed endpoint
- Call the seed endpoint against the PRODUCTION base URL (not localhost).
- Use curl from the Replit shell (or built-in HTTP client).
PROOF:
- Paste the exact curl command you ran and the full JSON response.
- Confirm the response includes: org id, org slug/name, and phone number id + E.164 number.

3) Verify diag shows the phone number
- Open the diag/timeline endpoint or admin/diag view we use and confirm the seeded org + phone number are present.
PROOF:
- Paste the relevant diag output (JSON or screenshot) showing the phone number record and the org it belongs to.

4) Test Twilio webhook behavior
- Hit the voice webhook URL the same way Twilio would (or run a safe test route if we have one).
- Confirm response no longer includes “not configured”.
PROOF:
- Paste the request you made (curl) and the full response body (TwiML or JSON).
- If there is a Twilio test call available in console, do it and paste the result status.

5) Add diagnostic endpoint (only if not already present)
- Implement a production-safe diagnostic endpoint that returns essential org + phone number configuration (redact secrets).
- Include: org exists, phone number exists, inbound webhook configured, public host, environment name.
- Must be protected (at minimum: require an admin token header or only enabled in non-production unless I explicitly approve production).
PROOF:
- Paste the endpoint path, sample curl call, and sample response.

6) Final confirmation checklist
PROOF:
- Provide a single final message with:
  - Production base URL
  - Seed endpoint called successfully (yes/no)
  - Org created (id)
  - Phone number created (E.164 + id)
  - Diag confirms phone number present (yes/no)
  - Twilio webhook no longer “not configured” (yes/no)
  - Links/paths to any code files changed for the diagnostic endpoint
