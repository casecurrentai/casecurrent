TASK: Remove DATABASE_URL placeholder fallback + restore fail-fast env validation

Context / Problem
We currently have a fallback placeholder URL like:
  postgresql://placeholder:placeholder@localhost:5432/placeholder
when process.env.DATABASE_URL is missing. This silently masks misconfiguration and turns a clear startup/config error into confusing downstream Prisma/migration/runtime failures. The prior non-null assertion validation behavior was removed.

Goal
1) App must FAIL FAST with a clear error if DATABASE_URL is required and missing.
2) No fake/default DATABASE_URL values anywhere.
3) Centralize env validation so all code uses the same source of truth.

Steps (do ALL)
A) Find where DATABASE_URL is read and where the placeholder fallback was introduced.
   - Rip out the placeholder string and any `|| "postgresql://placeholder..."` logic.
   - Remove any remaining direct usage of process.env.DATABASE_URL throughout the app where feasible.

B) Create a single env module, e.g. `server/env.ts` (or `src/env.ts` depending on repo structure):

   - Implement a helper:
     - requireEnv(name): reads process.env[name]
     - if missing/blank, throws Error: `Missing required environment variable: ${name}`
   - Export `DATABASE_URL = requireEnv("DATABASE_URL")`
   - If we already have zod in the project, it’s OK to use zod instead, but do not add new deps unless necessary.

C) Ensure env validation runs early.
   - Import the env module from the earliest server entrypoint (e.g., `server/index.ts`, `server/app.ts`, `server/start.ts`, etc.) so startup fails immediately if DATABASE_URL is missing.
   - Make sure Prisma client initialization uses the validated env (or relies on Prisma’s standard env loading but with our explicit validation first).

D) Add a preflight check for CI / scripts.
   - Add a script (or a small node/tsx script) that exits non-zero with a friendly message if DATABASE_URL is missing.
   - Wire it into the places that run migrations/seeding/tests/build in CI (where appropriate) so we fail before prisma migrate/seed runs.

E) Add `.env.example` update
   - Ensure `.env.example` includes DATABASE_URL with a commented example format.
   - Do NOT commit real secrets.

Acceptance Criteria
- If DATABASE_URL is unset or empty:
  - Running the server exits immediately with: “Missing required environment variable: DATABASE_URL”
  - Running migrations/seeding fails immediately with the same clear message.
- No code path uses a placeholder DB URL.
- No “silent success” when DATABASE_URL is missing.

Deliverables (must provide proof)
1) List of files changed with a short summary for each.
2) The exact code for the new env module.
3) The diff/snippet showing removal of placeholder fallback.
4) A repro log:
   - Unset DATABASE_URL and run server/migration command → show fail-fast message
   - Set DATABASE_URL (to the real secret in Replit) and run server/migration command → show success (at least gets past env validation)

Do not
- Do not introduce any placeholder/default DATABASE_URL.
- Do not degrade developer experience; instead improve error messages + .env.example + preflight.

Start by locating the placeholder fallback string in the repo and report where it appears before editing.
