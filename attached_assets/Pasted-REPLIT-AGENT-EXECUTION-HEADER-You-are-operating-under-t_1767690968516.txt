========================================================

CHECKPOINT 4.6 — MARKETING SIGNATURES + PRICING + DEMO PAGE (ALL-IN-ONE)
Create a Replit checkpoint named exactly: cp4_6_marketing-signature-pricing-demo

Context:
We are between CP4 and CP5. Marketing is not polished enough yet.
Issues to resolve now:
- Guilloche underlay not visible
- Wireframe/SectionFrame signature inconsistent across pages
- Pricing page needs exact copy + correct tier pricing
- Need a dedicated /demo page and route CTAs to /demo (distinct from /contact)

Goal:
Make the marketing site conversion-ready and brand-consistent BEFORE we proceed to CP5.

Scope:
Marketing pages only (unauthed):
- /, /how-it-works, /security, /solutions, /pricing, /resources, /contact, /demo

Do NOT implement telephony, AI, lead pipeline, or dashboard feature work in this checkpoint.

--------------------------------------------------------
1) SIGNATURE DESIGN ENFORCEMENT (SITE-WIDE)
--------------------------------------------------------

A) Guilloche underlay (must be present and confirmable)
- Implement as a reusable component (e.g., <GuillocheUnderlay />) inside the MARKETING PageShell.
- Guilloche must appear behind top nav + hero on ALL marketing pages listed above.
- It must NOT appear on authenticated dashboard routes.
- Add debug toggle:
  - If URL includes ?debugPattern=1, increase guilloche opacity enough that it is unmistakable.
  - Default remains subtle (low opacity).
- Ensure contrast/readability remains strong.

B) Wireframe signature / SectionFrame (must be consistent across pages)
- Ensure SectionFrame (wireframe outline + corner brackets + subtle connectors/dot-grid) can wrap sections cleanly.
- Apply SectionFrame in at least 2–3 sections on EVERY marketing page:
  - /how-it-works, /security, /solutions, /pricing, /resources, /contact, /demo, and homepage
- Do NOT use one-off per-page hacks; use the reusable component.

C) CTA consistency
- Update global marketing nav + homepage hero CTAs:
  - Primary CTA: “Book a Demo” → /demo
  - Secondary CTA: “Contact Sales” → /contact
- Ensure footer includes /demo link.

--------------------------------------------------------
2) PRICING PAGE — EXACT COPY + TIERS (NO SLA MENTION)
--------------------------------------------------------

Update ONLY /pricing content/structure using the exact copy below.
STRICT: Do NOT mention SLA or “performance guarantees” anywhere.

Pricing tiers (must match exactly):
- CounselTech Core: $349 / month
- CounselTech Pro: $749 / month (Most Popular)
- CounselTech Elite: $1,499 / month
- One-Time Setup: $500–$1,000

Layout requirements:
- Hero (headline + subheadline + 2 short supporting paragraphs)
- 3 tier cards: Core, Pro (Most Popular, visually emphasized), Elite
- One-Time Setup section (framed via SectionFrame)
- “Why Law Firms Choose CounselTech” section (framed via SectionFrame)
- Bottom CTA band (Book a Demo + Contact Sales)

--------------------------------------------------------
3) DEMO PAGE — /demo (PRIMARY CTA DESTINATION)
--------------------------------------------------------

Create /demo as a dedicated conversion page (distinct from /contact).

Page structure:
- Hero:
  Title: “See CounselTech AI in action”
  Subhead: “A 15-minute walkthrough tailored to your practice area and intake workflow.”
  Primary CTA: “Request a Demo” (scroll to form)
- “What you’ll see” section (SectionFrame):
  - Missed-call capture → structured lead → qualification → notifications → dashboard
- “Who it’s for” section:
  - PI, Criminal Defense, Family Law, Immigration (short bullets)
- “Implementation timeline” section (SectionFrame):
  - Setup + go-live in days (keep non-committal; do not promise fixed timeline)
- Demo Request Form (must persist):
  Fields:
  - name, email, firm_name, phone(optional), practice_area, current_intake_method (dropdown), monthly_lead_volume (dropdown), message(optional)
  - add a honeypot field for spam
  Behavior:
  - POST to API endpoint /v1/marketing/demo-request
  - show success state “We’ll reach out shortly.”
  - store submission in DB

Backend requirement (minimal and marketing-only):
- If a marketing submissions table already exists, reuse it.
- Otherwise create a new table via Prisma migrate:
  marketing_submissions:
    id, type('contact'|'demo'), name, email, firm(nullable), phone(nullable),
    practice_area(nullable), metadata(json), message(nullable),
    created_at
- Implement endpoints:
  - POST /v1/marketing/demo-request
  - (optional) POST /v1/marketing/contact if not already present
- Apply basic rate limiting + honeypot validation.
- Write audit_logs actor_type=system for each submission.

Admin view:
- Add a simple table in dashboard settings to view marketing submissions (type, date, name, email, firm, practice_area).

--------------------------------------------------------
4) VERIFICATION (REQUIRED BEFORE STOPPING)
--------------------------------------------------------
You must:
1) List each marketing route and confirm:
   - guilloche visible + debugPattern=1 makes it obvious
   - SectionFrame appears multiple times on the page
   - CTAs route to /demo
2) Confirm /pricing matches the exact copy and prices above, and contains NO SLA language.
3) Confirm /demo form submits and persists; admin table shows the record.
4) List the exact files changed and commands run.

Then create Replit checkpoint: cp4_6_marketing-signature-pricing-demo
Then STOP.
