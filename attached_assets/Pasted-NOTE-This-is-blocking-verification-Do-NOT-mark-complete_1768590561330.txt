NOTE: This is blocking verification. Do NOT mark complete until /api/version returns a real deployment identifier (not "local") on casecurrent.co from a mobile browser.

TASK: Fix /api/version and add reliable production build fingerprinting + no-cache

Problem
On https://casecurrent.co/api/version the response is still:
  {"sha":"local"}
This makes it impossible to verify that production picked up the latest build. We need a reliable build fingerprint on Replit Deployments.

Requirements (must all be implemented)
1) /api/version MUST return a real fingerprint in production:
   - sha: best available commit/deploy identifier (NOT "local")
   - buildTime: ISO timestamp set at server boot
   - nodeEnv
   - deploymentId (if available)
   - host
2) /api/version MUST be public (no auth) and MUST send Cache-Control headers to prevent stale caching.
3) On server startup, log exactly which env vars are available for commit/deploy so we can pick the right one on Replit.
4) Add a footer build badge (admin-only is fine) showing: sha + buildTime so UI also confirms.
5) If no commit/deploy env exists in production, generate a stable “DEPLOY_FINGERPRINT” at build/deploy time and expose it.

Implementation details
A) Server boot env discovery (do this once at startup; safe)
- In server/index.ts (or wherever app boots), add:
  - buildTime = new Date().toISOString()
  - Collect env keys matching /(COMMIT|SHA|GIT|DEPLOY|REPL)/i and log:
    [BUILD_ENV] key=value (mask long secrets; but these should be safe IDs)
  - Log:
    [BUILD_INFO] nodeEnv=... buildTime=... selectedSha=... deploymentId=...

B) Robust sha selection function
- Create helper getBuildFingerprint():
  Try in order (first non-empty wins):
    process.env.REPL_DEPLOYMENT_ID
    process.env.REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT_ID
    process.env.REPL_SLUG_COMMIT
    process.env.RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA
    process.env.VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA
    process.env.GITHUB_SHA
    process.env.COMMIT_SHA
    process.env.BUILD_SHA
  If none exist:
    - Use process.env.DEPLOY_FINGERPRINT if present
    - Else return "unknown" (NOT "local") in production
  Keep "local" ONLY when NODE_ENV !== "production" and hostname indicates local dev.

C) /api/version route
- Ensure route is mounted on the backend (Express), not a frontend/static handler.
- Response JSON:
  {
    sha,
    buildTime,
    nodeEnv,
    deploymentId,
    host
  }
- Add headers:
  Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate
  Pragma: no-cache
  Expires: 0

D) Ensure fingerprint exists even if Replit doesn’t provide commit SHA
- Add build/deploy step (or runtime one-time generation on boot) to set DEPLOY_FINGERPRINT:
  - If DEPLOY_FINGERPRINT not set, generate: crypto.randomUUID() + "-" + Date.now()
  - Store it in memory for the lifetime of the process (that’s fine for verifying a deployment)
  - Return it as sha when no commit vars exist.
This gives us a guaranteed “this exact server instance” identifier.

E) UI footer badge
- Add a small footer string for admin users:
  Build: <sha> @ <buildTime>
- This must reflect the same data as /api/version.

Acceptance tests (must pass on casecurrent.co from mobile Safari)
1) Open https://casecurrent.co/api/version
   - sha is NOT "local"
   - buildTime is present and recent
2) Refresh twice: response must not be cached (buildTime stays same for the same instance, but headers show no-store)
3) Footer badge shows the same sha/buildTime values as /api/version
4) Provide the startup log lines [BUILD_ENV] and [BUILD_INFO] in the Replit output so we can confirm which env vars exist.

Do not mark complete until you can prove the above in production.
