We own and use https://casecurrent.co and it is already connected to our Replit Deployment. counseltech.net and counseltech.legal are still connected but should be treated as legacy.

Goal: Make casecurrent.co the ONLY canonical public host and remove all remaining references to casecurrent.io and staging.casecurrent.io. Also add a server-side redirect so any request coming in on counseltech.* or *.replit.app is 301 redirected to https://casecurrent.co preserving the path and query string.

Constraints:
- Do not ask the user to run terminal commands.
- Make changes directly in the repo and print file contents for verification.

Tasks:
1) Search the entire repo for these strings and replace appropriately:
   - casecurrent.io -> casecurrent.co
   - staging.casecurrent.io -> staging.casecurrent.co
   - Any hardcoded references to counseltech.legal / counseltech.net that are being used as “public base URL” should be replaced with casecurrent.co unless they are intentionally historical comments.

2) Update mobile EAS settings:
   - In eas.json set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL to "https://casecurrent.co" for development, preview, and production (since staging is not confirmed live).
   - Ensure apps/mobile/src/services/api.ts uses EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL correctly and does not accidentally double-add /v1. Add a small guard that throws a clear error if the base URL contains "casecurrent.io".

3) Backend canonical host:
   - Identify the main HTTP server entry (Express/Next/etc).
   - Add middleware early that checks req.hostname (or Host header). If it is NOT "casecurrent.co", then 301 redirect to "https://casecurrent.co" + req.originalUrl.
   - Do NOT redirect localhost/dev.
   - Ensure this works for counseltech.legal, counseltech.net, and any *.replit.app domain.

4) Update any CORS or allowed-origins configuration:
   - Ensure casecurrent.co is allowed.
   - Do not accidentally block the mobile app; if you use origin allowlists, include https://casecurrent.co.
   - If there is a cookie domain configured, ensure it does not pin to counseltech.*.

5) Output:
   - List of files changed.
   - Full contents of: eas.json, apps/mobile/src/services/api.ts
   - The exact code snippet + file path where you added the redirect middleware.
   - A short note of any remaining counseltech.* references and why they were not changed.

Do all of the above now.
