REPLIT AGENT — DEBUG PREMATURE RESPONSES + TUNE BARGE-IN (SAFE, MINIMAL CHANGES)
Goal: Fix Avery speaking too early (e.g., “thank you Michael” with no pause) and reduce false barge-in from background audio, without adding new features.

PART A — FIND ROOT CAUSE (NO CHANGES YET)
1) Open `server/telephony/twilio/streamHandler.ts` and paste the full `session.update` payload block, including:
   - `modalities`
   - `turn_detection` (threshold + any other params)
   - `instructions`
   - `voice`
2) Find every place in Twilio stream handling where we send any of these messages to OpenAI:
   - `response.create`
   - `input_audio_buffer.commit`
   - `input_audio_buffer.clear`
   - `response.cancel`
   For each, paste ~15 lines before/after and explain exactly what triggers it (which event: session created, `speech_started`, `speech_stopped`, timer, etc.).
3) Confirm whether we send an initial `response.create` immediately after session creation. If yes, show that code.
4) Check if our instructions cause the model to “fill in” name or respond before input. If the prompt contains any “thank you [name]” pattern or encourages early closings, quote it.

PART B — TUNE BARGE-IN / VAD (SMALL, CONTROLLED CHANGE)
5) Based on what you find, propose ONE minimal code change to prevent Avery responding before the caller speaks (e.g., don’t commit/response.create until we have >= X ms audio, or until we see real speech frames).
6) Propose ONE minimal change to reduce false barge-in from background audio:
   - Adjust `turn_detection.threshold` OR other available VAD params, but keep it minimal.
   - IMPORTANT: Do NOT change `turn_detection.threshold` unless your findings clearly show VAD false-triggers are the cause; if you do change it, justify the value and make it a single-line edit.
7) Add minimal logging so we can verify: when speech_started/stopped fires, audio buffer duration at commit, and whether a response is already active before calling response.cancel/create.

SAFETY
- Make a checkpoint before edits.
- Keep changes minimal and reversible.
- Do not add new features.

OUTPUT REQUIRED
- Paste the relevant code snippets you found.
- State the exact change you made (diff-style).
- Tell me what to test and what logs should appear if fixed.
