Create a MOBILE BUILD DOSSIER for CaseCurrent that I can paste into ChatGPT and also save elsewhere for backup.

Rules:
- DO NOT include any secrets or tokens. Redact any values for keys like EXPO_TOKEN, OPENAI_API_KEY, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, DATABASE_URL, etc. If a file contains secrets, replace the value with "[REDACTED]".
- Output must be copy/paste friendly and organized with clear section headers.
- Include the FULL CONTENTS of the requested files (not summaries), unless they contain secrets—then redact.

Part 1 — File inventory (mobile-related)
Print a tree of all mobile-related files and configs:
- apps/mobile/**
- eas.json
- app.json / app.config.* (wherever it exists)
- package.json files relevant to mobile (apps/mobile/package.json and root package.json if it contains mobile scripts)
- any CI workflow that runs EAS (e.g., .github/workflows/*ios* or *expo*)

Part 2 — Print full file contents (redacted where needed)
Output the full contents of these files (in this order), each wrapped in a code block with the file path as the label:
1) eas.json
2) apps/mobile/app.config.ts (or app.json / app.config.js, whichever is used)
3) apps/mobile/package.json
4) apps/mobile/README_EAS.md and apps/mobile/README.md (if present)
5) apps/mobile/App.tsx
6) apps/mobile/src/services/api.ts
7) apps/mobile/src/services/realtime.ts
8) apps/mobile/tsconfig.json (if present)
9) apps/mobile/babel.config.* (if present)
10) apps/mobile/metro.config.* (if present)
11) apps/mobile/.env* files if they exist (BUT redact values)
12) Any EAS/Expo related config: expo config files, eas project ID reference, etc.

Part 3 — Environment and build settings summary (no secrets)
Provide a table of:
- EAS build profiles (development/preview/production/ios-device/etc)
- For each profile: distribution type, simulator true/false, env var keys used (values redacted except safe public ones like https://casecurrent.co)

Part 4 — WebSocket + API endpoint verification
Confirm from the backend code:
- What endpoint the mobile app calls for REST (base URL + /v1/...)
- Whether the WebSocket server is mounted at /v1/realtime and how auth works
Output the exact backend snippet showing WebSocketServer path and any relevant auth check (redact secrets).

Part 5 — Remaining domain/email references audit
Run grep (and print results) for:
- casecurrent.io
- counseltech.legal
- counseltech.net
- hello@casecurrent
- info@casecurrent
Show file paths and line numbers for any matches (ignore attached_assets/).

Part 6 — Republish note
State clearly whether a Replit “Republish” is required for these changes to take effect, and what component it affects (backend/web only vs mobile builds).

Deliverable:
At the very top, include:
- “MOBILE BUILD DOSSIER — CaseCurrent — <today’s date>”
- A short 5-bullet overview of what’s included.

Now produce the dossier.
