You are working in the CaseCurrent monorepo. Add Expo EAS build scaffolding for the mobile app located at apps/mobile/.

Goals:
1) Ensure the mobile app uses an environment variable EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL as the base URL for all API calls (defaulting to https://casecurrent.io if not set).
2) Add EAS configuration so we can produce device-installable dev builds and later store builds.
3) Do NOT break the backend or existing web app. Only add/modify mobile/EAS-related files and scripts.

Tasks:
A) In apps/mobile/, ensure there is an Expo app config file:
   - Prefer app.config.ts (or app.json if already present).
   - Set: name "CaseCurrent", slug "casecurrent", scheme "casecurrent".
   - Add iOS bundleIdentifier "io.casecurrent.app" and Android package "io.casecurrent.app".
   - Keep these identifiers in one place for easy later edits.

B) Add an eas.json at repo root with these build profiles:
   - development: internal distribution, developmentClient true, env { EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL: "https://staging.casecurrent.io" }
   - preview: internal distribution (or simulator where appropriate), env { EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL: "https://staging.casecurrent.io" }
   - production: store-ready, env { EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL: "https://casecurrent.io" }

C) Add repo scripts (root package.json and/or apps/mobile/package.json as appropriate) so I can run:
   - npm run mobile:start
   - npm run mobile:android
   - npm run mobile:ios
   - npm run eas:build:dev
   - npm run eas:build:preview
   - npm run eas:build:prod
Each script should cd into apps/mobile if needed and run the correct expo/eas command.

D) Add a short docs file at apps/mobile/README_EAS.md explaining:
   - Prereqs: Expo account + install eas-cli
   - Commands to run from repo root
   - How the EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL is set per profile
   - Reminder: EAS builds happen in Expo cloud; submission uses eas submit later

E) After changes, output:
   - A file tree of changed/added files
   - The exact contents of eas.json and the app config file
   - Any commands I must run locally

Make minimal assumptions. If you discover the mobile app isn't actually an Expo project yet, stop and report exactly what is missing and what you recommend creating.
