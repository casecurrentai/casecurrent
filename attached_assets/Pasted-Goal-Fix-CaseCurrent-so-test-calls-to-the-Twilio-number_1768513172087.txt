Goal: Fix CaseCurrent so test calls to the Twilio number create Leads that appear on /login dashboard for the Demo account.

1) Add end-to-end diagnostic logging for inbound calls:
   - On the Twilio inbound webhook handler (the route that receives incoming calls / starts the voice flow), log:
     [INBOUND] callSid, from, to, direction, timestamp
   - Normalize phone numbers to E.164 consistently (strip punctuation, handle leading 1, ensure +country).
     Log: [NORMALIZED] from=..., to=...
   - Log environment + DB identity:
     [ENV] NODE_ENV, VERCEL/REPL/RUNTIME identifiers, app base URL
     [DB] parsed DATABASE_URL host, db name, and schema (do NOT log password)

2) Make tenant resolution explicit and safe:
   - Resolve tenant strictly from normalized "to" number (the Twilio number being called).
   - Query PhoneNumber (or equivalent) by normalized number.
   - If not found, log: [TENANT_MISS] to=... and return a controlled response (and ensure the call flow tells user "number not configured" only when truly missing).
   - If found, log: [TENANT_HIT] phoneNumberId, firmId/orgId.

3) Ensure lead creation always attaches firm/org:
   - When creating Lead, store firmId/orgId and callSid.
   - Log: [LEAD_CREATED] leadId, firmId/orgId, callSid.
   - If lead already exists for callSid, log [LEAD_EXISTS] and reuse.

4) Add a protected diag endpoint (behind DIAG_TOKEN) to eliminate env/db confusion:
   GET /v1/diag/telephony-status?to=+1XXXXXXXXXX
   Returns JSON:
     - env identifiers
     - db host/db name
     - phoneNumber record found? firmId/orgId?
     - leads count for that firm/org in last 24h
     - most recent lead (id, callSid, createdAt)

5) Verify frontend dashboard query:
   - Confirm the dashboard is fetching leads for the logged-in user’s firm/org.
   - Add temporary log in the leads API: [LEADS_QUERY] orgId/firmId, limit/offset, returnedCount.

6) Fix number seeding so the Demo account always has the Twilio test number in the deployed DB:
   - Ensure the existing seed-phone-number endpoint inserts into THE SAME DATABASE used by the deployed server.
   - Add log: [SEED] db host/db name + inserted phoneNumberId + firmId/orgId.
