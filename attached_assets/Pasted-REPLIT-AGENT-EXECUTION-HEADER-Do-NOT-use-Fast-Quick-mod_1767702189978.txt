REPLIT AGENT EXECUTION HEADER
Do NOT use Fast/Quick mode. Use the most thorough reasoning/planning mode available.
Implement ONLY this checkpoint. Do NOT start new features beyond what is listed here.
After completion create a Replit checkpoint named exactly: cp10_1-visual-parity-and-backend-proof
Stop after completion.

========================================================
CHECKPOINT 10.1 — VISUAL PARITY (COUNSELTECH.NET) + BACKEND PROOF REPORT
========================================================

GOALS:
A) Fix marketing UI so it matches counseltech.net’s spacing/hierarchy and visibly includes the signature guilloche + wireframe framing on ALL marketing pages.
B) Produce a “Backend Proof Report” so the owner can verify the product is actually sellable (OpenAPI present, migrations present, smoke tests run, Twilio routes exist if implemented).

SCOPE:
- Marketing pages only for design changes (/, /solutions, /how-it-works, /security, /pricing, /resources, /contact or /demo).
- Backend report is read-only verification + running tests; do not add new features.

--------------------------------------------------------
A) VISUAL PARITY FIX (COUNSELTECH.NET FEEL)
--------------------------------------------------------

1) Ensure ALL marketing pages use ONE shared MarketingLayout/PageShell (nav + footer + global background layers).
- If any marketing page does not use MarketingLayout, refactor it so it does.
- MarketingLayout should not apply to authenticated dashboard pages.

2) Guilloche signature MUST be visible:
- Add/confirm a GuillocheUnderlay component mounted behind the top nav + hero on ALL marketing pages.
- Add debug toggles:
  - ?debugPattern=1 => guilloche opacity becomes unmistakable
  - ?debugFrame=1   => outline the guilloche container so we can confirm it is mounted and positioned
- Fix z-index/background layering so the guilloche is not hidden by an opaque layer.
- Default (no debug params) should be subtle but still perceptible on high-quality displays.

3) Wireframe signature MUST be present across the whole marketing site:
- Implement/confirm a reusable SectionFrame component (corner brackets, thin strokes, subtle connectors).
- Apply SectionFrame at least 2 times on EVERY marketing page (not just homepage).
- Increase usage on pages that look “empty” by framing major sections.

4) Spacing + hierarchy improvements (match counseltech.net’s rhythm):
- Increase vertical spacing between sections (consistent section padding).
- Enforce a consistent typography scale: big hero H1, strong H2 section headers, short subheads, readable body.
- Convert “dense” blocks into card grids (like counseltech.net):
  - 3-up capability cards
  - 6–12 “Everything included” feature cards
- CTAs: ensure primary CTA is consistent across pages (“Book a Demo”) and placed in hero and bottom CTA band.

5) Create a visual verification page:
- Add /design-audit (unauthed) listing links to every marketing page with ?debugPattern=1&debugFrame=1 appended.
- Include a checkbox list of requirements:
  - Guilloche visible in debug mode
  - SectionFrame appears multiple times
  - Section spacing consistent
  - CTA buttons consistent

--------------------------------------------------------
B) BACKEND PROOF REPORT (NO NEW FEATURES)
--------------------------------------------------------

Create a markdown file at /docs/BACKEND_PROOF_REPORT.md containing:

1) DB
- Prisma schema present (path)
- List migrations (names + timestamps)
- Confirm seed exists and what it creates (org + owner user etc.)

2) API + OpenAPI
- Confirm /docs (OpenAPI/Swagger) endpoint exists and how to access it
- List all implemented /v1 routes (grouped by feature area)
- Confirm auth flow endpoints exist and are working

3) Smoke tests
- Run the API smoke tests (or add minimal ones if missing, but do not expand scope)
- Paste the exact command(s) run and the output summary (pass/fail)

4) Telephony/Twilio status
- List whether these routes exist and what they do:
  /v1/telephony/twilio/voice
  /v1/telephony/twilio/status
  /v1/telephony/twilio/recording
  /v1/telephony/twilio/sms
- If not implemented yet, state clearly: “not implemented in this build.”

5) Known gaps
- A short list of what is NOT implemented yet that would be needed for production onboarding (e.g., firm provisioning wizard, phone number mapping UI, etc.), if applicable.

REQUIRED VERIFICATION BEFORE STOPPING:
- Provide 3–5 URLs to test visually:
  /?debugPattern=1&debugFrame=1
  /pricing?debugPattern=1&debugFrame=1
  /solutions?debugPattern=1&debugFrame=1
  /how-it-works?debugPattern=1&debugFrame=1
  /design-audit
- Confirm guilloche is unmistakable in debug mode.
- Confirm SectionFrame appears multiple times on every marketing page.
- Confirm BACKEND_PROOF_REPORT.md exists with the above sections.

Create Replit checkpoint: cp10_1-visual-parity-and-backend-proof
Then STOP.
