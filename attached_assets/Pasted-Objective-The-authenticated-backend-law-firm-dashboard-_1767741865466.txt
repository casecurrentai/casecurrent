Objective
The authenticated “backend” (law-firm dashboard) currently renders like the desktop layout on mobile. Convert ALL backend pages to a true mobile-first experience so firms can comfortably manage leads, calls, and messages from their phone.
Scope (must cover every authenticated page)


Dashboard / Overview


Calls / Voicemails / Call detail views


Messages / SMS / Chat threads


Leads / Intake submissions / Lead detail views


Settings / Integrations / Users / Billing (any admin pages)


Any other backend routes (audit and include all)


Requirements


Mobile-first responsive layout




Implement responsive design that prioritizes small screens first, then scales up.


Use a single-column layout on phones; avoid desktop multi-column grids on small screens.


Ensure no horizontal scrolling on mobile at any viewport width.


Use proper breakpoints (e.g., sm/md/lg) to progressively enhance for tablet/desktop.




Navigation designed for mobile




Replace desktop sidebar behavior on mobile with a bottom navigation bar OR a compact hamburger menu + sticky top bar (choose whichever fits the existing design system best).


Keep primary actions reachable with one thumb (calls, messages, leads).


Provide clear active-state indicators.




Tables and dense data must be mobile-usable




Convert tables into stacked “cards” on mobile (each record becomes a card with key fields).


Add filter + search controls that work well on mobile.


Ensure tap targets are large enough; avoid tiny icons/links.




Call + message workflows must be phone-friendly




Call detail and message thread screens must be readable, with correct spacing and typography.


Message input must be sticky at the bottom of the screen, not obscured by iOS/Android keyboards.


Ensure quick actions are prominent: “Call back,” “Text back,” “Mark as resolved,” “Assign,” etc.


Use safe-area insets (notches) and ensure sticky elements don’t overlap content.




UI polish and accessibility




Consistent spacing scale, readable font sizes on mobile, and clear hierarchy.


Buttons and interactive elements must meet accessibility tap-target guidelines.


Confirm contrast and focus states are correct.


Implementation notes


Do not change backend functionality, APIs, or data models—this is UI/UX refactor only.


Reuse existing components/styles where possible, but create responsive variants as needed.


Audit and update shared layout components (dashboard shell, nav, page container) so fixes apply everywhere consistently.


Add a simple “Responsive QA checklist” section in the repo README or a dev note (what pages were tested, key breakpoints, and any known limitations).


Definition of done


Every backend page looks intentionally designed on mobile, not merely “shrunk desktop.”


No horizontal scroll on iPhone-sized viewports.


Navigation and core workflows (responding to messages, reviewing calls, managing leads) are comfortable and fast on a phone.
