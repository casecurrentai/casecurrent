Build a new premium marketing page for the CaseCurrent voice assistant “Avery” using the same structure, spacing, and component patterns as the existing marketing pages (see screenshot reference of the “Solutions for Every Practice” page).
	1.	Add a new marketing route:

	•	Path: /voice (preferred) (or /avery if routing conventions require)
	•	Page title: “Avery Voice Intake”
	•	Meta description: “Avery answers every call instantly with emotionally intelligent intake, structured summaries, routing, and premium voice options including ElevenLabs Professional Voice Cloning.”

	2.	Add a new top navigation tab to this page:

	•	Label: “Voice AI” (or “Avery (Voice)” if that matches site naming)
	•	Style it as a premium nav item:
	•	Desktop: pill-style link with deep blue or purple background + thin gold border + subtle hover glow
	•	Mobile menu: add a small “Premium” badge next to it
	•	Keep styling subtle and consistent with the brand (no loud gradients).

	3.	Page content and sections (build in this order, matching existing marketing-page format):
A) Hero

	•	H1: “Avery: Human-Sounding Voice Intake”
	•	Body: “Avery answers every call instantly, keeps conversations calm and natural, captures clean intake details, and routes the right matters to your team—without hold music, missed calls, or inconsistent handling.”
	•	CTAs: “Book a Demo” (primary), “Contact Sales” (secondary)
	•	Chips: “24/7 Answering”, “Real-Time Intake + Routing”, “Premium Voice Options”

B) Feature cards section (same card layout style as “Practice Areas”)
Section title: “What Avery Can Handle”
Subtitle: “Designed for real callers—confused callers, stressed callers, angry callers—and built to keep the conversation moving with empathy and structure.”
Cards:
	1.	New Case Intake (chips: Guided questions, Confirmation prompts, Clean summaries)
	2.	Emotional Callers (chips: De-escalation, Gentle pacing, Trauma-aware tone)
	3.	Lead Qualification (chips: Urgency flags, Disqualifier checks, Intake completeness)
	4.	Scheduling + Routing (chips: Warm transfer logic, Call-back capture, After-hours coverage)
	5.	Follow-Ups That Convert (chips: SMS/email nudges, Document links, No-pressure follow-ups)

	2.	Signature Voice (Mid-Tier Add-On) with label: “Powered by ElevenLabs Professional Voice Cloning”
	•	Emphasize: solo practitioners, brand continuation, consistency, “same Avery brain, but your voice”
	•	Add fine print: “Signature Voice requires attorney consent and firm-provided recordings. Avery always discloses she is an AI assistant.”
	3.	Multi-Voice Routing (Top Tier / Enterprise)
	•	Emphasize: different voices by department/practice area, unified intake brain, brand consistency at scale

	4.	Design requirements:

	•	Reuse existing typography, spacing, and background guilloche patterns.
