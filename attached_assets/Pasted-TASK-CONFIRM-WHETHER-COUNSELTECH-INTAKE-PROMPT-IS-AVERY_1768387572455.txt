TASK: CONFIRM WHETHER COUNSELTECH_INTAKE_PROMPT IS AVERY’S ACTIVE PRIMARY CONVERSATION RULES (PROD + DEV)

Goal:
Determine if `COUNSELTECH_INTAKE_PROMPT` (and the exported `VOICE_SETTINGS`) is the prompt/settings actually used when Avery answers calls in the deployed environment.

Requirements:
1) Locate the source file that exports:
   - `COUNSELTECH_INTAKE_PROMPT`
   - `VOICE_SETTINGS`
   Report the full file path.

2) Find every import/reference to `COUNSELTECH_INTAKE_PROMPT` across the repo.
   - List each file path and the exact line(s) where it is imported/used.
   - If it is not referenced anywhere, state that clearly.

3) Identify the exact runtime entrypoint that handles live calls (Twilio webhook / realtime session / websocket handler).
   - Find where the OpenAI Realtime session is created or updated (e.g., `session.update`, `instructions`, `system prompt`, etc.).
   - Report the file path and show the exact code block where the prompt/instructions are set.

4) Determine whether prompt selection is dynamic.
   Check for any logic that chooses a prompt based on:
   - env vars (e.g., PROMPT_VERSION, BRAND, MODE)
   - database/org settings
   - per-number config
   - per-firm config
   If found, explain what chooses what, and which branch runs in production.

5) Add an explicit verification mechanism (do NOT break anything):
   - Insert a unique non-user-facing marker into the active prompt path ONLY (preferred: logs; acceptable: prompt marker if logs are not feasible).
   Options:
     A) Log marker: When setting `instructions`, log:
        `[PROMPT_ACTIVE] using COUNSELTECH_INTAKE_PROMPT`
        or
        `[PROMPT_ACTIVE] using <other prompt>`
     B) Prompt marker: Add a line near the top of the prompt:
        `[PROMPT_MARK: 2026-01-14-A]`
        (Only if it will not be read aloud; if it might be spoken, DO NOT do this. Use logging instead.)

6) Provide a short “How to verify” checklist for Mike:
   - Exactly which endpoint/log line to check
   - Exactly what he should see to confirm the active prompt

Output format:
- Section 1: Export location (path)
- Section 2: All references/usages (paths + code lines)
- Section 3: Live call entrypoint (path + code snippet)
- Section 4: Prompt selection logic (if any)
- Section 5: Verification change made (what/where)
- Section 6: How Mike confirms in one test call

Constraints:
- Do not refactor or rename prompts yet.
- Do not change branding identifiers.
- Do not change core call flow behavior.
- Only add minimal logging/marker necessary to confirm which prompt is active.
