You are Replit Agent (Design Tab). Your job: make ALL CounselTech marketing pages + the CounselTech client mobile app match the current CounselTech.net visual system EXACTLY (typography, spacing, wireframe “AI blueprint” callouts, button styles, and overall polish). Do not invent a new aesthetic.

NON-NEGOTIABLE: MATCH THE EXISTING COUNSELTECH.NET UI
1) Typography must match CounselTech.net exactly.
   - Do NOT guess the font.
   - Identify the exact font family/weights by inspecting CounselTech.net computed styles (DevTools) and/or pulling the font import from its CSS.
   - Apply the same font stack across:
     - Marketing website (all routes)
     - Mobile app (all screens)
   - Match heading sizes, letter spacing, and weight hierarchy.

2) Spacing/layout must match CounselTech.net:
   - Same max width container, section padding, gutters, card spacing, and vertical rhythm.
   - Same soft shadows, border radii, and line separators.

SIGNATURE DESIGN ELEMENT (NEW, BUT MUST FEEL NATIVE TO COUNSELTECH.NET)
Add a subtle guilloche underlay BEHIND the top navigation / top app bar:
- Implement as a very light linework pattern (SVG or CSS background).
- Confined to navbar/top-bar area only (not the full page).
- Opacity ~3–6%, thin strokes, slightly softened; fade out downward (mask/gradient).
- Must not reduce contrast/legibility.
- No animation required; respect prefers-reduced-motion.

THE “WIREFRAME AI ELEMENTS” THAT MUST EXIST EVERYWHERE
CounselTech.net has a blueprint / wireframe annotation feel that highlights sections. Replicate it consistently:
- Use thin 1px lines, corner brackets, subtle nodes/dots, and faint measurement/connector lines.
- These wireframe accents should:
  - Outline/anchor feature cards
  - Point at key UI blocks (steps, grids, dashboards)
  - Appear as subtle overlays, never noisy
- Keep them extremely light (low opacity) so content remains primary.

COLOR + UI TOKENS (DERIVE FROM SITE, DON’T GUESS)
- Pull primary brand blue, hover blue, background tint, border color, text colors from CounselTech.net.
- Implement as CSS variables (or Tailwind tokens) and reuse across web + mobile app.
- Buttons must match: same radius, padding, font weight, shadow, hover states.

MARKETING WEBSITE: APPLY TO ALL ROUTES
Routes include at minimum:
- /
- /solutions
- /how-it-works
- /security
- /pricing
- /resources (+ any subpages)
Global components:
- Navbar with guilloche underlay + same link spacing as CounselTech.net
- Primary CTA: “Book a Demo” (same styling)
- Secondary links: “Sign in” etc.
- Footer with the same column layout and type hierarchy as CounselTech.net

PAGE STRUCTURE MUST MATCH COUNSELTECH.NET CONTENT
Preserve the existing information architecture and copy for:
- /solutions (AI Voice Agent, Smart Qualification, Instant Follow-up, Everything included grid, CTA)
- /how-it-works (3-step flow + “What happens next” timeline + CTA)
Do not rewrite the page content. Only improve layout fidelity to the existing CounselTech.net styling system.

MOBILE APP: MUST LOOK LIKE COUNSELTECH, NOT A GENERIC TEMPLATE
Design a client mobile app that feels like CounselTech.net translated to mobile:

App-wide:
- Same font stack as the marketing site (exact match).
- Same blue/neutral palette tokens.
- Same card style (radius/shadow/border).
- Top app bar uses the guilloche underlay (subtle), just like the website navbar.
- Use the same wireframe/blueprint callout motifs lightly in the background of dashboards and key analytics sections.

Critical UI fix (known issue):
- The top app bar MUST NOT overlap/cover the rounded corners of the first analytics cards below it.
- Add correct safe-area padding + vertical spacing so cards sit cleanly below the header (no collision).

Mobile app navigation:
- Bottom tab bar (5 tabs):
  1) Dashboard
  2) Leads
  3) Calls
  4) Automations
  5) Settings

Key screens (design + layout, consistent with CounselTech.net):
1) Dashboard
   - “Today” summary cards (Missed calls, New leads, Qualified, Booked consults, Response time)
   - Simple charts (line/bar) with clean axes and the same UI style as the website
   - “Live Status” pill/badge styling consistent with marketing site

2) Leads
   - List with strong hierarchy: lead name, status badge, case type, score, timestamp
   - Filter chips (All / New / Qualified / Signed / Disqualified)
   - Lead detail screen:
     - Summary panel (score, urgency, conflict check result)
     - Transcript snippet
     - Timeline of events (call → score → follow-up → appointment)
     - Primary action button style identical to “Book a Demo” style (adapted for app actions)

3) Calls
   - Call log list with icons, duration, transcript availability
   - Call detail:
     - Audio player (if present), transcript, extracted fields, routing outcome
     - “Create task / Send follow-up / Assign” actions

4) Automations
   - Simple toggles + status indicators
   - “Webhook / Zapier-style” integration tiles (clean, enterprise)
   - Logs list: timestamped events, success/failure

5) Settings
   - Organization profile, team members, roles, notification prefs
   - Security section styled like the marketing “Security” page (trust cues, clean lists)

DELIVERABLES
- Update/standardize the entire marketing site to match CounselTech.net typography + spacing + wireframe elements.
- Apply the guilloche navbar/top-bar underlay across marketing + mobile app.
- Produce a cohesive design system (tokens + components) shared by web + mobile so everything feels like one product family.

QUALITY BAR
If any element looks “template-y” or not like CounselTech.net, revise it until it matches. The goal is visual continuity: a user should instantly recognize the app as CounselTech from the typography and blueprint/wireframe motifs alone.
