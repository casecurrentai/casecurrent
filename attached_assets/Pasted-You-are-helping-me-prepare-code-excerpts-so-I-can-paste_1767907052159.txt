You are helping me prepare code excerpts so I can paste them into ChatGPT Codex for debugging and a telephony migration plan. 
Goal: output the critical files’ contents into a SINGLE copyable text block so iOS copy-select works reliably.

IMPORTANT OUTPUT RULES
- Put your final output in ONE single fenced code block (triple backticks), so it’s easy to copy in one gesture.
- Inside that one code block, include file separators exactly like:
  ===== FILE: path/to/file.ext =====
  <full file contents>
- Do NOT truncate unless a file is enormous. If you must truncate, say “(TRUNCATED)” and include the first ~200 lines and last ~200 lines.
- Do NOT include secrets. If you detect keys/tokens, redact values but keep variable names.

IF YOU CANNOT FIT EVERYTHING IN ONE BLOCK
- Tell me at the top: “MULTI-PART OUTPUT: Part 1 of N”
- Then still use the same single code block format for each part.
- Make sure you number the parts and list which files are included in that part.
- Also include a short “Copy plan” line telling me the order to paste into Codex.

FILES TO COLLECT (priority order)
1) Package and runtime:
   - package.json
   - package-lock.json or pnpm-lock.yaml or yarn.lock (whichever exists)
   - tsconfig.json (if present)
   - .env.example (if present) and any env schema/validation file (but redact values)

2) App entry + server wiring (the most important):
   - The main entry file (server.js/index.js/app.js, src/index.ts, src/server.ts — whatever actually starts the server)
   - The file where routes are mounted (router index)
   - Any middleware setup (especially raw body parsing, JSON parsing, webhook signature verification)

3) Telephony + webhook routes:
   - Any Twilio webhook handlers/routes (voice + sms + status callbacks)
   - Any “telephony” folder, “twilio” folder, “webhook” folder, “voice” folder, or similar
   - Any OpenAI realtime/voice integration files that interact with telephony

4) Config + utilities:
   - config files, constants, env loader, logger utilities
   - any request validation utilities

DISCOVERY STEP (do this before printing)
- Search the repo for these keywords and include the files that contain them:
  "twilio"
  "Bandwidth"
  "telephony"
  "webhook"
  "TwiML"
  "BXML"
  "X-Twilio-Signature"
  "rawBody"
  "express.raw"
  "voice"
  "/v1/telephony"
  "openai"
  "realtime"
- After discovering, print the final file list you’re including (paths) BEFORE the big code block.

DELIVERABLE
- Output the list of included file paths.
- Then output the one big copyable code block containing the files (with separators).
