REPLIT AGENT EXECUTION HEADER
You are operating under the CounselTech V1 CONSTITUTION already provided.
Implement ONLY the single checkpoint specified in this message. Do NOT start future checkpoints.
Stop immediately after completing this checkpoint.
Create a Replit checkpoint named exactly: cp4_5-marketing-site

========================================================
CHECKPOINT 4.5 — MARKETING SITE (MATCH PROVIDED DESIGN THEME)
========================================================
Goal:
Build a public marketing website inside the existing Next.js web app that matches the visual theme shown in the provided screenshot:
- clean enterprise SaaS
- light background
- subtle guilloche / security-pattern underlay near the top nav and hero
- rounded cards with soft borders/shadows
- “wireframe / callout” style section framing (thin lines, corner brackets, subtle dot-grid accents)
- UI-preview blocks (dashboard + mobile app mock panels)
Do NOT copy counseltech.net code/assets. Create an original implementation in the same category.

Scope:
Add public routes (unauthed) within /apps/web (Next.js):
- / (Home)
- /how-it-works
- /security
- /solutions
- /pricing
- /resources (blog index stub)
- /contact

Navigation:
Top nav with left logo + links + right-side CTA button.
Sticky top bar with subtle translucent background.

Design system (must implement as reusable components):
- PageShell (nav + footer)
- Hero (headline, subhead, CTA group, hero visual area)
- FeatureCard (icon, title, description)
- SectionFrame (wireframe-like outline + subtle connector lines/corner brackets)
- UIFrame (browser-window mock frame for web screenshots)
- PhoneFrame (mobile device mock frame for app screenshots)
- StatPill / MetricCard (small analytic blocks like the screenshot)
- TimelineStepper (for how-it-works)
- TrustList (checklist sections on security page)

Visual style requirements (encode in CSS/Tailwind):
- Background: very light neutral (near-white) with faint dot-grid layer in some sections.
- Accents: deep navy/ink for primary text; muted gray for body; restrained blue as primary accent; soft green as “success” accent.
- Cards: white surfaces, 12–16px radius, 1px border in light gray, very soft shadow.
- Typography: modern sans (system is fine), strong H1/H2 hierarchy, lots of whitespace.
- Guilloche underlay: implement as an SVG pattern (very subtle opacity) positioned behind nav/hero only.
- Wireframe callouts: implement using pseudo-elements or SVG lines in SectionFrame; keep subtle.

Content structure (must match screenshot’s layout logic):
HOME (/)
1) Hero
   - H1: “CounselTech AI Intake + Lead Capture”
   - Subhead: enterprise-trustworthy, simple, measurable outcomes
   - Primary CTA: “Book a Demo”
   - Secondary CTA: “See How It Works”
   - Right side hero visual: a framed UI mock (use UIFrame + 3–4 FeatureCards floating/stacked; include subtle “connector” lines)
2) “Everything included” section
   - A grid of 6 FeatureCards (AI Voice Agent, Smart Qualification, Instant Follow-up, Webhooks/Integrations, Dashboard Analytics, Security & Compliance)
3) “How it works” preview section
   - SectionFrame with 3-step cards and a TimelineStepper
4) “Client Mobile App” preview section
   - Use PhoneFrame components to show 3–4 screens (dashboard, leads list, lead detail, settings)
   - These are illustrative (static mock UI built with HTML/CSS), not functional app screens.
5) Final CTA band

HOW-IT-WORKS (/how-it-works)
- Top hero + short summary
- Step cards (capture → qualify → follow-up → deliver to staff)
- TimelineStepper with 4–6 steps
- Include a framed “dashboard preview” area similar to screenshot

SECURITY (/security)
- Hero: “Security you can explain to a law firm”
- Two-column layout:
  - Left: Trust checklist (RBAC, audit logs, encryption in transit/at rest, retention controls, tenant scoping)
  - Right: stacked security cards in a UIFrame
- Add “Data boundaries” section explaining org_id scoping and auditability (truthful; do not claim SOC2 unless your product actually has it—mark “SOC2 Type II: planned” unless implemented)

SOLUTIONS (/solutions)
- Practice areas grid + operational outcomes:
  - Personal Injury, Criminal Defense, Family Law, Immigration
- For each: common intake fields and what gets captured
- Include “Integrations” section: Zapier webhook + placeholders for Clio/MyCase

PRICING (/pricing)
- 2–3 tier cards (Starter, Growth, Enterprise) – copy can be stubby, but layout must be real and consistent with design system

RESOURCES (/resources)
- Blog index stub page with 6 placeholder cards (title, excerpt, date)

CONTACT (/contact)
- Contact form (name, email, firm, message)
- Submit to API endpoint POST /v1/marketing/contact
- Add spam controls:
  - honeypot field
  - basic rate limit on endpoint

Backend requirement for contact form:
Add a new table (Prisma + migration):
- marketing_contact_submissions:
  id, org_id(nullable), name, email, firm(nullable), message, created_at, metadata(json nullable)
If org_id is not known (public), allow null.
Add endpoint:
- POST /v1/marketing/contact
Store submission + write audit_log actor_type=system.

SEO basics:
- metadata tags per page
- OpenGraph defaults
- robots.txt + sitemap.xml (basic static ok)

Rules:
- Do NOT implement telephony/AI features in this checkpoint.
- Do NOT touch schema unrelated to contact submissions.
- Use the existing component library patterns; don’t create a second styling system.
- All pages must be linked in nav/footer.

Verification required before stopping:
1) All marketing pages render without auth.
2) Nav/footer works.
3) Contact form submits and persists to DB.
4) Add a simple admin view in dashboard settings to list contact submissions (table view only).

After completion:
- List files created/modified
- List commands run
- Confirm what is NOT implemented yet
- Create Replit checkpoint: cp4_5-marketing-site
Then STOP.
