URGENT TASK: FIX ELEVENLABS API KEY + MAKE “HOPE” VOICE AVAILABLE + STOP SILENT CALLS

Context / Symptoms
- Calls only play the Twilio failsafe: “Avery is connecting, one moment”, then silence.
- Logs show ElevenLabs TTS is failing and ttsFrameCount=0.
- Replit can list voices via ElevenLabs, but “Hope” is not appearing, meaning the API key being used by the app is NOT tied to the ElevenLabs workspace where “Hope” exists.
- Current Replit Secrets include ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID and ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID_AVERY but DO NOT include an ElevenLabs API key secret.

Goal
1) Ensure the app uses the NEW ElevenLabs API key from the correct workspace (where “Hope” exists).
2) Confirm “Hope” appears in GET /v1/voices for that key.
3) Set Avery to use Hope’s voice_id.
4) Add a hard fallback so calls never go silent even if ElevenLabs fails again.
5) Republish.

Step-by-step Requirements

A) Add the missing ElevenLabs API key secret
1) Create a new Replit Secret:
   - Name: ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
   - Value: (the new ElevenLabs API key I just created in the SAME workspace where “Hope” exists)
2) Do NOT put this key into any other existing secrets.

B) Ensure code reads the correct env var for ElevenLabs auth
1) Search the codebase for ElevenLabs header usage: "xi-api-key"
2) Ensure the ElevenLabs request ALWAYS uses:
   - process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY first
   - fallback to process.env.XI_API_KEY second (optional)
3) Add a safe startup log that confirms the key is loaded WITHOUT printing it:
   - [ELEVENLABS_KEY] present=true length=<len>
   - If missing: present=false

C) Verify that “Hope” is visible to this API key (non-negotiable)
1) Add a one-time debug function/route or script that calls:
   GET https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/voices
   Header: xi-api-key: process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
2) Log the voice IDs + names returned (at least the first 30).
3) Confirm that a voice named “Hope” appears in this list.
   - If it does NOT appear: the key is still for the wrong workspace. STOP and fix workspace/key mismatch.

D) Set Avery voice ID to Hope
1) Once Hope appears in the list, capture its voice_id.
2) Update Replit Secrets:
   - ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID_AVERY = <Hope voice_id>
   - ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID       = <Hope voice_id>
3) Confirm the runtime log prints:
   [TTS_VERIFY] Using ElevenLabs voiceId=<Hope voice_id>

E) Make silence impossible (fallback)
1) In the ElevenLabs TTS wrapper: if any non-2xx response occurs, log:
   - status code
   - error body
   - voiceId used
2) Implement fallback behavior for the current utterance:
   - Retry ONCE using a fallback voiceId that is known-good (pick “Matilda” if needed: XrExE9yKIg1WjnnlVkGX)
   - If retry fails, use Twilio <Say> (Polly or default) to speak the response text so the caller never hears silence.
3) Add a final call summary log including:
   - ttsFrameCount
   - number of TTS failures
   - whether fallback was used

F) Republish + validate
1) Republish the app.
2) Place a test call.
3) Confirm in logs:
   - [ELEVENLABS_KEY] present=true
   - Hope is listed in /v1/voices
   - [TTS_VERIFY] Using ElevenLabs voiceId=<Hope id>
   - No ElevenLabs 400 errors
   - ttsFrameCount > 0
4) If Hope still isn’t visible, report back with:
   - the /v1/voices output (names + ids)
   - which env var is being used for xi-api-key
   - whether ELEVENLABS_API_KEY is present at runtime
