NOTE FOR REPLIT AGENT:
Implement exactly what’s requested below. Do NOT mark complete until the acceptance tests pass on MOBILE (iPhone Safari) and DESKTOP. Keep existing routes working. Prefer minimal dependencies (CSS scroll-snap over adding heavy carousel libs) unless absolutely necessary.

TASK: Fix Lead Detail mobile UX (no horizontal tab scrolling) + improve “Unknown Caller” display + make the Dashboard name not PI-specific.

WHY:
- On mobile, the Lead detail sub-navigation (Activity / Calls / Messages / Intake / Score / Tasks) overflows horizontally and requires the user to scroll sideways to reach tabs (bad UX).
- Lead header still shows “Unknown Caller” and “Not assigned” even when we have partial intake data somewhere; we need “best available” display logic so the UI looks intelligent even before the pipeline is perfect.
- “PI Analytics Dashboard” is too narrow as a product name. We need a more general label while keeping the underlying metrics compatible with contingency PI firms in Louisiana.

PART 1 — Lead Detail: Replace overflow tabs with swipeable “cards” on mobile
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Goal:
On mobile (< md breakpoint), the Lead detail sections should be presented as swipeable cards (carousel-like). Each card corresponds to one section:
- Activity
- Calls
- Messages
- Intake
- Score
- Tasks

Requirements:
1) Desktop/tablet behavior (>= md) should remain as current tabs (no regression).
2) Mobile behavior (< md):
   - No horizontal scrolling tab bar.
   - Show a compact “section selector” (pills OR dots) + the swipeable cards beneath it.
   - User can swipe left/right to move between cards.
   - The selector reflects the active card as the user swipes.

Implementation guidance (preferred):
- Use CSS scroll-snap for a lightweight carousel:
  - container: overflow-x-auto, flex, snap-x snap-mandatory, scroll-smooth, touch-pan-x
  - each card: w-full shrink-0 snap-start
- Track active index with IntersectionObserver (preferred) OR onScroll + math fallback.
- Keep each card’s content the same components currently rendered in each TabPanel so logic stays consistent.

UI details:
- Each card should look like a shadcn “Card” (or your existing Card component).
- Put the selector above the card stack:
  - Pills: “Activity”, “Calls”, “Messages”, “Intake”, “Score”, “Tasks”
  - Or dots with labels (either is fine). Pills are clearer.
- Optional: Add subtle left/right chevrons for discoverability, but swiping must work without them.

Acceptance tests (Mobile):
A) On an iPhone-sized viewport, the Lead detail page shows pills/dots + a card. No tab strip requiring sideways scroll.
B) You can reach Score and Tasks by swiping; no horizontal scrolling is needed anywhere.
C) The active pill/dot updates as you swipe.
D) Desktop still shows normal tabs and everything works.

Files likely involved (adjust to your structure):
- apps/web/src/pages/leads/LeadDetail*.tsx (or equivalent)
- any Tabs component wrapper used on Lead detail

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PART 2 — “Best available caller identity” (stop showing Unknown Caller when we have clues)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Goal:
Improve Lead header + Lead list display so it uses the best available name and practice area.

Implement “best available” displayName resolution:
Use the first non-empty value in this order:
1) lead.displayName (or lead.name if that’s your field)
2) contact.fullName / contact.displayName (if a Contact relation exists)
3) intake.callerName (flat)
4) intake.caller.fullName (nested legacy format)
5) fallback: “Unknown Caller”

Practice area display:
Use first non-empty:
1) lead.practiceArea (if present)
2) intake.practiceAreaGuess
3) intake.practiceArea (legacy/nested if exists)
4) fallback: “Not assigned”

Also:
- Always show caller phone (from Contact or intake.callerPhone / caller.phone).
- If score exists, show Score badge (e.g., “Score 72 • High”); otherwise omit.

Acceptance tests:
E) After a call where caller says “My name is John Smith”, Lead list and Lead header show “John Smith” (not Unknown Caller) IF the data exists anywhere in lead/contact/intake.
F) If practiceAreaGuess exists, it appears instead of “Not assigned”.

Files likely involved:
- Lead list row component
- Lead header component on Lead detail
- Any mapper/selector utilities

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PART 3 — Rename “PI Analytics Dashboard” to a general product name (without breaking routes)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Goal:
Keep the dashboard functionality, but rename UI text so it isn’t narrowly “PI”.

Requirements:
1) Keep existing route(s) working:
   - If current path is /dashboard, keep /dashboard.
   - If analytics endpoint is /v1/analytics/pi-dashboard, keep it for now (backward compatible).
2) Update UI labels:
   - Page title: change from “PI Analytics Dashboard” → “Intake Analytics Dashboard” (or “Client Intake Dashboard”).
   - Subtitle can mention “optimized for contingency PI firms” if you want, but the main title must be general.
3) Optional but recommended:
   - Add a small “Practice Area filter” UI later; for now you may simply label the funnel sections in a practice-area-agnostic way (Inbound Calls, AI Answered, Human Answered, Consult Scheduled, Retainer Signed, etc.).

Acceptance tests:
G) Dashboard page renders with the new title and still loads data.
H) No broken links; existing nav “Dashboard” works.

Files likely involved:
- Dashboard page component
- Left nav config
- Any constants for labels

DELIVERABLES
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Implement mobile swipe-card UX for Lead detail sections.
2) Implement best-available display name + practice area resolution for Lead list + Lead header.
3) Rename PI dashboard UI strings to a general “Intake Analytics Dashboard” (keep routes stable).
4) Provide a short list of changed files + confirmation that acceptance tests A–H pass.
