You are Replit Agent. Your job is to produce a COMPLETE, strictly technical, current-state architecture + codebase rundown of the CounselTech project exactly as it exists in this workspace right now.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
- Do NOT propose future work, redesigns, or “next steps” until after you have documented what already exists.
- Do NOT hand-wave (“there should be…”, “likely…”, “assumed…”). If it exists, cite where. If it does not exist, say “NOT IMPLEMENTED.”
- Every claim must be traceable to a file path and (when relevant) function/class name.
- Prefer concrete evidence: file tree, key exports, route list, schemas, env vars, queue jobs, cron, background workers, and external integrations.

DELIVERABLE FORMAT (use these exact sections)

0) Executive Snapshot (technical)
- What this system currently is (monolith vs services), runtime, language(s), framework(s)
- How it is deployed in Replit (build/start commands, hosting mode)
- What works end-to-end today (list only what you can prove)

1) Full Repository Map
- Print the full current file tree (top to bottom). No omissions.
- Identify the “entrypoint” file(s) actually used at runtime.

2) Runtime + Build Configuration
- package.json: scripts, dependencies, devDependencies
- tsconfig / build tooling / bundler settings
- Replit config files (replit.nix, replit.yaml, .replit, etc.), and what they do
- Node version / runtime assumptions

3) Environment Variables + Secrets
- List every env var referenced in code, with file path(s) and line references (or exact identifiers).
- Indicate which are REQUIRED vs optional.
- Identify how secrets are loaded (dotenv, Replit secrets, etc.)

4) API Surface Area (Backend)
- Enumerate ALL HTTP endpoints (method + path) and for each:
  - file path + handler function name
  - auth requirements (JWT/session/API key), middleware stack
  - request/response schema (JSON shapes)
  - side effects (DB writes, external API calls)
- Include webhook endpoints (Twilio/OpenAI/etc.) explicitly.

5) AuthN/AuthZ
- Current auth strategy (sessions/JWT/OAuth/etc.)
- User/firm/role model: how authorization decisions are made
- Any admin/superadmin logic
- Password handling / hashing / token rotation (if present)

6) Data Layer
- What database is used (Postgres/SQLite/etc.) and connection method
- ORM/query builder (Prisma/Drizzle/etc.), schema/migrations location
- List core tables/models with fields (firm, user, lead, call, message, voicemail, intake, etc.)
- Any file storage (S3/local) and where used

7) Telephony + Voice (MOST IMPORTANT)
Give a precise rundown of EVERYTHING implemented for voice/telephony:
- Twilio (or other carrier) configuration in code: inbound calls, webhooks, call status callbacks
- SIP trunking status: implemented or not? show files/routes
- OpenAI Realtime API usage: implemented or not? show code, WS endpoints, events handled
- Speech-to-text / text-to-speech paths (Whisper, Realtime, etc.)
- Call recording, transcription, voicemail ingestion pipeline
- Warm transfer / call routing logic, if any
For each item: show exact code location and data flow.

8) Messaging (SMS/MMS/Email/Web Chat)
- SMS sending + inbound handling
- Web chat widget / website messaging
- Email sending and templates
- Any queues/retries/deduplication logic

9) “Agentic” Intelligence Layer
- Where prompts live (paths), how versioned, how loaded
- Tool/function-calling implementation (if any)
- RAG/knowledge base: ingestion, embeddings, retrieval (if any)
- Guardrails/disclaimers logic and where enforced

10) Frontend / Dashboard / Mobile
- What UI(s) exist (marketing site vs dashboard vs mobile)
- Framework(s) used (Next/React/etc.)
- Auth integration with backend
- Mobile responsiveness status (show routes/pages and CSS approach)

11) Observability + Ops
- Logging framework and where logs go
- Error handling + alerting
- Rate limiting, CORS, security headers, CSRF, input validation
- Background jobs/workers/cron and where defined

12) Tests
- Test framework, what tests exist, how to run them
- Coverage reality (if none, say NONE)

13) Gaps / Not Implemented (hard truth)
- Bullet list the missing pieces required for a sellable CounselTech voice agent platform
- For each missing item, reference the closest related code area (or say “no related code exists”)

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- This must be long, detailed, and technical.
- Include code snippets ONLY when they prove a key claim (keep each snippet under ~40 lines).
- Use exact file paths everywhere.
- End with a concise “current maturity score” (0–10) for: telephony, realtime voice, agentic tools, dashboard, security.

Now produce the report.
